## OTHER IDEAS

## CONTRIBUTING

I'm open to anything that could make [Tornado Action](https://tornadoaction.com) better, not just PR's.

That said, this is just a fun side project for now so mileage may vary on project progress & response times.

## LICENSE

When it comes to my code: if the repo's public - fell free to use it.

If you do straight up copy-paste any of the code in your own project, throw me some love with a credit (repo/project links).
